## Getting Started

This section will guide you through the process of setting up your development environment for this project.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** version 1.8 or higher 

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
Compile the code:

CopyReplit
javac Graph_M.java
Run the application:

CopyReplit
java Graph_M
Usage
Upon running the application, you will be presented with a menu of options. The application allows you to:

List all metro stations.
Show the metro map.
Get the shortest distance between two stations.
Get the shortest time to reach between two stations.
Get the shortest path based on distance between stations.
Get the shortest path based on time between stations.
Exit the application.
Example
After launching the application, you can interact with it as follows:

CopyReplit
~~LIST OF ACTIONS~~
1. LIST ALL THE STATIONS IN THE MAP
2. SHOW THE METRO MAP
3. GET SHORTEST DISTANCE ...
...
You can enter the corresponding number to choose an action.

Features
Add and remove stations and routes (edges) between them.
Check for direct paths between stations.
Calculate the shortest path based on distance and time.
Display the entire metro map in a user-friendly format.
Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please adhere to the following guidelines:

Fork the repository.
Create a new branch (git checkout -b feature-branch).
Make your changes and commit them (git commit -m 'Add new feature').

Features
Graph Representation: Efficiently represents metro stations and connections using graph data structure.
Dynamic Management: Easily add and remove stations and routes (edges) between them.
Pathfinding: Check for direct paths between stations and find the shortest route.
User-Friendly: Displays the entire metro map and list of stations in a clear format.
Flowcharts
Flowcharts that illustrate the flow of operations within the application can be beneficial for understanding. Below are some example flowcharts to consider:

Flowchart for User Interaction: 
Flowchart for User Interaction

Flowchart for Dijkstra’s Algorithm: 
Flowchart for Dijkstra’s Algorithm

(Replace link-to-your-flowchart with the actual links to your flowcharts once created.)
