# Metro App

A Java application that represents a metro system using a graph data structure. It provides functionalities for managing metro stations, adding edges (routes), checking for paths, and calculating the shortest distance and time between stations.

## Getting Started

This section will guide you through the process of setting up your development environment for this project.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** version 1.8 or higher 

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yuvi72/Metro_Map.git
   cd Metro_Map
Compile the code:

CopyReplit
javac Graph_M.java
Run the application:

CopyReplit
java Graph_M
Usage
Upon running the application, you will be presented with a menu of options. The application allows you to:

List all metro stations.
Show the metro map.
Get the shortest distance between two stations.
Get the shortest time to reach between two stations.
Get the shortest path based on the distance between stations.
Get the shortest path based on the time between stations.
Exit the application.
Example
After launching the application, you can interact with it as follows:

CopyReplit
~~LIST OF ACTIONS~~
1. LIST ALL THE STATIONS IN THE MAP
2. SHOW THE METRO MAP
3. GET SHORTEST DISTANCE ...
...
You can enter the corresponding number to choose an action.

Features
Graph Representation: Efficiently represents metro stations and connections using the graph data structure.
Dynamic Management: Easily add and remove stations and routes (edges) between them.
Pathfinding: Check for direct paths between stations and find the shortest route.
User-Friendly: Displays the entire metro map and list of stations in a clear format.
Flowcharts
Flowcharts that illustrate the flow of operations within the application can be beneficial for understanding. Below are some example flowcharts to consider:

Flowchart for User Interaction:
